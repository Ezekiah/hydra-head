h2. How you can use Alternative Field Names in Solr to Enforce Permissions

h3. The Access Controls Evaluation helpers

In your controllers and views you can test whether the current user has read or edit permissions on the current document by calling {reader?} or {editor?}

To test another type of permission, you can use {test_permission?}

h2. Assigning "Public" permissions

In order to give permissions to the public (including users who are not logged in), simply grant group permissions for the "public" group.  For example, to give the public "read" permissions, add this to the rightsMetadata

<pre>
  <access type="read">
    <machine>
      <group>public</group>
    </machine>
  </access>
</pre>

This will add "public" to read_access_t in solr.
