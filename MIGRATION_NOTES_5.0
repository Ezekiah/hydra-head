* The generated configs are for Solr 3.5 (upgraded from 1.4).  It ought to work with other versions of solr if you provide your own configs.
* get_file_asset_count(solr_doc) has been replaced by 
  fedora_doc.file_asset_count (or just fedora_doc.parts.length if you prefer)
* remove User.send(:include, Hydra::GenericUserAttributes) from config/initializers/hydra_config.rb
* replace any instance of "include Hydra::Catalog" with "include Hydra::Controller::ControllerBehavior"
 
* We've removed app/views/catalog/_default_group.html.erb and app/views/catalog/_document_list.html.erb
* Hydra::AssetsControllerHelper moved to hydra-file-access.  Is this the correct place?

* If you previously ran the hydra generator it created a method: ApplicationController#layout_name.  Ensure it is returning a value corresponding to a template in your app/views/layouts directory.  Or remove it altogether to use the default blacklight template.

* hydra-core no longer overrides the blacklight views in any way. If you want to keep the old views copy them from a copy of the hydra-head 4.x gem into your application

* hydra-file-access is not required by default.  If you need those behaviors, add "gem 'hydra-file-access'" to your Gemfile.

* TODO: activate the relavent integration tests in test_support/features
