* The generated configs are for Solr 4.0 (upgraded from 1.4).  It ought to work with other versions of solr if you provide your own configs.
* get_file_asset_count(solr_doc) has been replaced by 
  fedora_doc.file_asset_count (or just fedora_doc.parts.length if you prefer)
* remove User.send(:include, Hydra::GenericUserAttributes) from config/initializers/hydra_config.rb
* replace any instance of "include Hydra::Catalog" with "include Hydra::Controller::ControllerBehavior"
 
* We've removed app/views/catalog/_default_group.html.erb and app/views/catalog/_document_list.html.erb
* Hydra::AssetsControllerHelper moved to hydra-file-access.  Is this the correct place?

* If you previously ran the hydra generator it created a method: ApplicationController#layout_name.  Ensure it is returning a value corresponding to a template in your app/views/layouts directory.  Or remove it altogether to use the default blacklight template.

* hydra-core no longer overrides the blacklight views in any way. If you want to keep the old views copy them from a copy of the hydra-head 4.x gem into your application

* hydra-file-access is not required by default.  If you need those behaviors, add "gem 'hydra-file-access'" to your Gemfile.


* IMPORTANT - Do NOT create update() methods in the catalog controller.  Blacklight is now using Catalog#update method to store pagination information into the session.  Thus hydra is no longer enforcing any access controls on Catalog#update.

* Methods in Ability class have ceased passing around user and session in the method signature (they're now relying on instance variables). If you've overridden any of these methods, you may receive an error like: `ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (0 for 2)`  You ought to be able to just remove these parameters from the signature.

* Hydra::Controller no longer includes Hydra::Controller::RepositoryControllerBehavior by default as all it's methods are deprecated.  If you still require RepositoryControllerBehavior, include it manually on your controller.
