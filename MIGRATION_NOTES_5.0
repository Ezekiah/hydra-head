* The generated configs are for Solr 3.5 (upgraded from 1.4).  It ought to work with other versions of solr if you provide your own configs.
* get_file_asset_count(solr_doc) has been replaced by 
  fedora_doc.file_asset_count (or just fedora_doc.parts.length if you prefer)
* remove User.send(:include, Hydra::GenericUserAttributes) from config/initializers/hydra_config.rb

* We've removed app/views/catalog/_default_group.html.erb and app/views/catalog/_document_list.html.erb
* Hydra::AssetsControllerHelper moved to hydra-file-access.  Is this the correct place?

* TODO: activate the relavent integration tests in test_support/features
