Hydra-Head Engines Plugin
================

Introduction goes here.


Installation Instructions
=======

h3. Prerequisites
* ruby v 1.8.7 or higher
* rubygems
* these ruby gems:
** bundler
** rails version < 3.
* git
* java 1.6 or higher


h3.  Installation Instructions to Run Hydra-Head tests:

1. Get the hydra-head engines plugin from github

<pre>
git clone git@github.com:projecthydra/hydra-head.git hydra-head
cd testing-hydra-head
</pre>

NOTE:  I believe it *must* be called "hydra-head" and there can't be anything
called "hydra-head" in sibling directories or their children


2. Use bundler to install the gem dependencies.

<pre>
bundle install
</pre>


3. Pull a copy of jetty pre-configured for Hydra with Fedora and Solr installed.
Also pull a rails application set up just for testing the Hydra-Head engines plugin.

<pre>
git submodule init
git submodule update
</pre>

(currently not working.  Try:)

<pre>
  git clone git@github.com:projecthydra/hydra-plugin_test_host.git hydra-plugin_test_host
  git clone git@github.com:projecthydra/hydra-jetty jetty
</pre>


4.  Migrate the databases

You must do this from the testing rails application directory, not from the engine plugin directory

You need to be sure there is nothing else named "hydra-head" approximating an engines plugin in any part of the directory tree with the root node 3 levels up from the testing application.

<pre>
cd hydra-plugin_test_host
rake db:migrate:plugins RAILS_ENV=test
</pre>


4. Run the bundled copy of Jetty, preloaded with Fedora and Solr applications.

Note that java 1.6 must be invoked by the "java" command or Hydrangea won't work.

You must do this from the engines plugin directory, not from the testing rails application directory.

<pre>
rake hydra:jetty:load
</pre>

This will start up jetty on port 8983.


4.  Load test fixtures into Fedora/Solr

You need to do this from the engines plugin directory, not from the testing application directory.

<pre>
rake hydra:default_fixtures:refresh RAILS_ENV=test
</pre>

(TO DO: get rid of irrelevant fixtures; get rid of non-generic fixtures)


6.  Run specs 

You need to do this from the engines plugin directory, not from the testing application directory.

<pre>
rake hydra_head:rspec
</pre>

The Hydra Framework would not exist without the extensive design effort undertaken by representatives of repository initiatives from Stanford University, University of Virginia and University of Hull.  Contributors to that effort include Tom Cramer, Lynn McRae, Martha Sites, Richard Green, and Chris Awre.  

Thorny Staples from Fedora Commons & DuraSpace deserves special thanks for putting all of these people in the same room together.
