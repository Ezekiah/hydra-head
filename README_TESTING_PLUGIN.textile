Hydra-Head Engines Plugin
================

This is the Ruby on Rails 2 Engines Plugin containing the code for a Hydra
Ruby on Rails application:

- Blacklight for the User Interface
- Solr for the Search Engine
- ActiveFedora to let the rails application talk to fedora
- OM to streamline the metadata configuration
- Solrizer to write Fedora content to the Solr index
- SolrizerFedora for something.

This code will soon migrate to:
a rails 3 engines plugin
a rails 3 engines plugin gem


Installation Instructions
=======

h3. Prerequisites
* ruby v 1.8.7 or higher
* rubygems
* these ruby gems:
** bundler
** rails version < 3.
* git
* java 1.6 or higher


h3.  Installation Instructions to Run Hydra-Head tests:

1. Make an empty directory, call it whatever you want.

Make an empty directory, call it whatever you want, then cd into that directory and clone the hydra-head plugin:

<pre>
  mkdir hydra-head-test
  cd hydra-head-test
</pre>

You have to do this because the test host app adds "../../" to its plugin paths, which allows it to load its _parent_ directory as a plugin but will also load all of that parent's sibling directories as plugins as well.  In order to test just the plugin, it must live in a directory all by itself.  This is a hack that will only last until we upgrade to rails3 or find a better hack.


2. Get the hydra-head engines plugin from github.

While in your empty hydra-head-test directory:

<pre>
git clone git@github.com:projecthydra/hydra-head.git hydra-head
cd hydra-head
</pre>

NOTE:  I believe it *must* be called "hydra-head" 

This hydra-head directory is the _root_ of the _plugin_


3. Use bundler to install the gem dependencies.

<pre>
bundle install
</pre>


4. Pull a copy of jetty pre-configured for Hydra with Fedora and Solr installed.
Also pull a rails application set up just for testing the Hydra-Head engines plugin.

<pre>
git submodule init
git submodule update
</pre>


5.  Migrate the databases.

You must do this within the _hydra-plugin_test_host directory_, not at the root of the plugin. 

You need to be sure there is nothing else named "hydra-head" approximating an engines plugin in any part of the directory tree with the root node 3 levels up from the testing application.

<pre>
cd hydra-plugin_test_host
rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test
rake db:migrate:plugins RAILS_ENV=test
</pre>

or

<pre>
cd hydra-plugin_test_host
rake db:drop RAILS_ENV=test
rake db:migrate:all RAILS_ENV=test
</pre>

Now cd back up to the root of the _plugin_:

<pre>
  cd ../
</pre>


6. Run the bundled copy of Jetty, preloaded with Fedora and Solr applications.

Note that java 1.6 must be invoked by the "java" command or Hydrangea won't work.

You must do this at the root of the _plugin_, not within the hydra-plugin_test_host directory.

<pre>
rake hydra:jetty:load
</pre>

This will start up jetty on port 8983.


7.  Load test fixtures into Fedora/Solr.

You must do this at the root of the _plugin_, not within the hydra-plugin_test_host directory.

<pre>
rake hydra:default_fixtures:refresh environment=test
</pre>

(TO DO: get rid of irrelevant fixtures; get rid of non-generic fixtures.)


8.  Run specs.

You must do this at the root of the _plugin_, not within the hydra-plugin_test_host directory.

<pre>
rake hydra_head:rspec
</pre>


LAST: Don't forget to stop the jetty server!

You must run the rake task at the root of the _plugin_, not within the hydra-plugin_test_host directory

<pre>
rake hydra:jetty:stop
</pre>

Use ps to ensure the java process has stopped.  If not, kill it manually.



A. If you need to Re-run the tests:

Clean out the fixtures:

A1.  Stop jetty
at the root of the _plugin_
<pre>
rake hydra:jetty:stop
  Use ps to ensure the java process has stopped.  If not, kill it manually.
</pre>

A2.  Clean out Solr and Fedora on Jetty
<pre>
cd jetty
git clean -df
git checkout .
git status     should show nothing to commit
cd ..   (back to root of the _plugin_)
</pre>

A3.  Re-initialize and start Jetty:
<pre>
rake hydra:jetty:load
</pre>

A4. Reload the pristine fixtures.
<pre>
  rake hydra:default_fixtures:refresh environment=test
</pre>


B.  If you need to clean out the databases:

<pre>
cd hydra-plugin_test_host
rake db:drop RAILS_ENV=test
rake db:migrate:all RAILS_ENV=test
</pre>
