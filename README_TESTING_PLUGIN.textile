h1. Hydra-Head Engines Plugin Testing

This is the Ruby on Rails 2 Engines Plugin containing the code for a Hydra
Ruby on Rails application.  The full hydra stack includes the following:

- Blacklight for the User Interface
- Solr for the Search Engine
- ActiveFedora to let the rails application talk to fedora
- OM to streamline the metadata configuration
- Solrizer to write Fedora content to the Solr index
- SolrizerFedora for something.

This code will soon migrate to:
a rails 3 engines plugin
a rails 3 engines plugin gem


h2. Installation Instructions

h3. Prerequisites
* ruby v 1.8.7 or higher
* rubygems
* these ruby gems:
** bundler
** rails version < 3.
* git
* java 1.6 or higher


h3.  Installation Instructions to Run Hydra-Head tests:

0.  We strongly suggest using RVM  (ruby virtual machine) as a means of keeping your different ruby applications with their specific gem requirements from having version clashes. 

See https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/

If you don't have the desired ruby version in RVM, e.g. ree-1.8.7, then install it.
<pre>
rvm install ree-1.8.7
</pre>

1.  For the current Rails 2 incarnation, you have to install hydra-head as a plugin in a full rails application.  We have a preconfigured testing application created for this purpose.  

<pre>
  git clone git@github.com:projecthydra/hydra-plugin_test_host.git my-hydra-head-testing-app
  cd my-hydra-head-testing-app
</pre>

2.  We use a git BRANCH of the testing rails application for this testing:
<pre>
  git checkout installed-plugin
</pre>

3.  Follow the instructions in the README_FOR_HYDRA_HEAD_TESTING of hydra-plugin_test_host
