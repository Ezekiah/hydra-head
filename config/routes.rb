  # Routes for the HydraHead application are defined in HydraHead::Routes
  #
  # These routes can be injected into your Rails application by adding
  #     HydraHead.add_routes(self)
  # to the application's ./config/routes.rb. The injected routes can be 
  # customized as well, e.g.:
  #     HydraHead.add_routes(self, :only => [:file_assets]) # will only load file_asset routes
  #     HydraHead.add_routes(self, :except => [:catalog]) # will not load catalog routes
end
