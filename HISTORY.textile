h3. 3.1.0
* Updated to ActiveFedora 3.1.1
* Update rake tasks to leverage jettywrapper
* Don't fork processes to run tests
* Refactor helpers, so that applications can easily override them
* Remove Djatoka support

h3. 3.0.1

* generator has the correct solr config files
* reverted back to using object_type_facet for "Format" facet.  This is instead of using active_fedora_model_s, which made some cucumber tests unstable because active_fedora_model_s is populated inconsistently by ActiveFedora (really we should deprecate that solr field)

h2. 3.0.0: Upgrade to Rails 3

h3. 0.0.1

Pulled plugin code from Hydrus 
* Javascript disabled, progressive enhancement set up
