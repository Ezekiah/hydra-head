h3. 4.1.0
* Add AccessControlsEnforcement to AssetsController
* Upgrade to active fedora ~>4.1
* Upgrade to solrizer-fedora 2.1.0
* Upgrade to blacklight ~> 3.4 
* Improved access controls api
* HYDRA-817 allow overriding of where we redirect_to, so that nested routes will work
* Extracted hydra-mods and hydra-access-controls
* Deprecation fest in preparation for 5.0
* HYDRA-822 Move GlobalConfig into Hydra. It was removed from Blacklight.
* HYDRA-831 apply_depositor_metadata should not overwrite existing user permissions
* HYDRA-832 depositor should apply depositor metadata if the properties datastream exists
* Fix up layout to better match blacklight.

Note about deprecations:  We encourage the implementer to create their own controllers
for CRUD operations and use standard Rails forms rather than using the AssetsController 
and the AssetsControllerHelpers. In the 5.0 series these capabilites will be removed from
HydraHead.  If you want to continue using these modules, you should copy the appropriate 
files from this release into your local Hydra application. Further simplified examples 
of this approach will be forthcoming. Until then, scholarsphere is a great exemplar.
