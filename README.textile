h1. Hydra-Head

This is the core part of Hydra code needed to create a Hydra application.

For a more thorough overview of the Hydra framework, see "HYDRA_OVERVIEW.textile":http://github.com/projecthydra/hydrangea/blob/master/HYDRA_OVERVIEW.textile

This is (currently) a Ruby on Rails 2 Engines Plugin.  It will eventually become a Rails 3 Engines Plugin, and then a Rails 3 Engines gem.

h3. Design & Strategic Contributions

The Hydra Framework would not exist without the extensive design effort undertaken by representatives of repository initiatives from Stanford University, University of Virginia and University of Hull.  Contributors to that effort include Tom Cramer, Lynn McRae, Martha Sites, Richard Green, and Chris Awre.  

Thorny Staples from Fedora Commons & DuraSpace deserves special thanks for putting all of these people in the same room together.
