h1. hydra-head Rails Engine

The hydra-head rails engine gives you the basic functionality for creating a Hydra Head.  Hydra Heads are specialized interfaces to Fedora Repositories.

This is your starting point for taking advantage of the technologies developed by the "Hydra Project":http://projecthydra.org.  The project wiki is at http://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra.

h2. What is a Hydra Head?

Hydra Heads combine:

* Ruby on Rails ["homepage":http://rubyonrails.org]
* Blacklight ["code":https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight| "homepage":http://projectblacklight.org]
* ActiveFedora ["code":https://github.com/mediashelf/active_fedora| "homepage":http://yourmediashelf.com/activefedora/]
* OM ["code":https://github.com/mediashelf/om]
* Solrizer ["code":https://github.com/projecthydra/solrizer]
* Hydra Head Access Controls based on Hydra rightsMetadata
* Hydra Head View Helpers
* Hydra Medatata jquery plugin

Underneath a Hydra Head, content is stored in a Fedora Repository and indexed in Solr.  

h2. Developer Tools for Building Hydra Heads

When you use this code to develop your own Hydra Head, you will also benefit from

* Hydra step definitions for cucumber tests
* Hydra rake tasks for working with Fedora and Solr
* For development and prototyping we provide "hydra-jetty":https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-jetty, which is a copy of jetty with Fedora and Solr pre-installed.

h2. Hydra Content Types

When you create a Hydra Head that deals with a new type of content, you often want to expose that same content in other Hydra Heads.  To do this, put the models & views for that content type into a Rails Engine and bundle it up into a gem.  That way anyone can install that gem into their own Hydra Heads and start using it.

h2. How to build a Hydra Head

# Create a Rails Application
# Install the hydra-head gem and require it in your Rails app
# Install the gems for any Hydra Content Types that you want to use in your Hydra Head
# Write some tests & start coding

When you've got something working, post it on github and email the hydra-tech mailing list to let us know what you're up to.

When you want to show off your work, create a 5-15 minute screencast showing the unique features of your head.  You can then submit the screeencast, along with information about your Hydra Head, to the Hydra Head Showcase.
